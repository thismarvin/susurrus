# susurrus

a simple lightweight javascript library intended to help create highly performant visualizations for the web.

...

Well thatâ€™s the plan at least.

In reality, Susurrus is essentially a blank slate that will be etched as I learn WebGL. Moving forward Susurrus will take inspiration from much cooler libraries (e.g. MonoGame, p5.js, pygame) and design principles from morro, another open-source project I am working on.
